# Bahadir-Eray-BootcampFinishProject
## Libraries and technologies used
* Navigation component : one activity contains multiple fragments instead of creating multiple activites.
* Retrofit : making HTTP connection with the rest API and convert meal json file to Kotlin/Java object.
* Room : Save meals in local database.
* MVVM & LiveData : Saperate logic code from views and save the state in case the screen configuration changes.
* Coroutines : do some code in the background.
* view binding : instead of inflating views manually view binding will take care of that.
* Glide : Catch images and load them in imageView.
